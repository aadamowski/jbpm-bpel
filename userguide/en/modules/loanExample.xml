  <title>Loan Example</title>
  
  <para>This chapter presents an all-time BPM classic: loan approval. An individual or
    company in seek of funds applies for a loan in a financial organization. Small amounts
    are approved automatically. Large amounts are presented to an agent for further
    evaluation. The agent has the final word on approving or rejecting the loan.</para>
    
  <para>Some variants of the example take into account the credit of the borrower. In this
    instance, however, that aspect was disregarded in favor of focusing on the human 
    participation in the process. Neither BPEL4WS 1.1 nor WS-BPEL 2 specify an activity
    that allows direct people involvement. The present example demonstrates how to get
    people involved through a partner task management service.</para>
    
  <para>The task management service introduced here builds upon the jPDL task management <ulink 
    url="http://docs.jboss.com/jbpm/v3/userguide/taskmanagement.html">model</ulink>.
    This solution has two advantages. First, it leverages a proven model and makes its
    facilities immediately available to client applications. Second, it shares database resources
    with jPDL processes.</para>
